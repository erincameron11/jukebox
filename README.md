**Question**: Design a touch screen music jukebox, which allows the user to select from a menu of the five most popular songs of the week. Draw a sketch of this interface for each of the following menu types: Binary menu, Multiple-Item menu, Check boxes, Pull-down menus. Argue which design serves the user best.


**Solution**: This simple HTML page provides a groundwork to examine the 4 menu types against this problem, with very basic styling included through CSS, and basic functionality for the binary menu done in JavaScript.
